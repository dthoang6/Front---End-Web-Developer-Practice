const JSX = <div>
    <h1>Create a Complex JSX Element</h1>
    <p>When rendering multiple elements like this, you can wrap them all in parentheses, but it's not strictly required. Also notice this challenge uses a div tag to wrap all the child elements within a single parent element. If you remove the div, the JSX will no longer transpile. Keep this in mind, since it will also apply when you return JSX elements in React components.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.</li>
      <li>This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of nested elements.</li>
      <li>For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will not transpile.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>;
